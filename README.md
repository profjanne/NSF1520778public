EAGER_Presurvey containts the source code for an Android app for a tablet. Users need to complete the presurvey through this app. The corresponding tablet needs to have internet connection for the survery responses to send to the server. This app for the tablet contains various types of survey questions: multiple choice questions, open-ended questions, questions adapting map UI (Google Map), and other types of questions.

EAGER_Study contains the source code for an android app for an Android smartphone. The app contains survey notification prompting feature based on time and location. This app needs to extract some of the presurvey data from the server, so the presurvey in the tablet has to be done first before setting up this app.
